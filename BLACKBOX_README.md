The EducationDetails.php file is a Livewire component that allows users to enter their educational details. The component has five public properties, one for each of the following:

* The name of the institute the user attended for their 10th grade
* The name of the university the user attended for their first degree
* The start date of the user's first degree
* The end date of the user's first degree
* The percentage grade the user received in their first degree
* The specialization the user studied for their first degree
* The name of the institute the user attended for their 12th grade
* The name of the university the user attended for their second degree
* The start date of the user's second degree
* The end date of the user's second degree
* The percentage grade the user received in their second degree
* The specialization the user studied for their second degree
* The name of the institute the user attended for their graduate degree
* The name of the university the user attended for their third degree
* The start date of the user's third degree
* The end date of the user's third degree
* The percentage grade the user received in their third degree
* The specialization the user studied for their third degree

The component also has a mount() method, which is called when the component is first rendered. This method is used to initialize the component's properties.

Finally, the component has a render() method, which is used to render the component's view. This method returns a view called livewire.education-details.

Here is an example of how to use the EducationDetails.php component:

```
<livewire:education-details />
```

This will render a form that allows users to enter their educational details.
